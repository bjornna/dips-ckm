			use = <"Use as a generic containter to record a summary or overview of a patient's health and/or welfare status as a snapshot of their health at a specified point in time. 

The author of a health summary is usually a clinician who is familiar with the all of the relevant aspects of the individual's health that is the content of the summary.

The scope of a health summary can vary in different contexts, ranging from an overview of all key aspects of the individual's health and/or welfare to a summary of information focused on a limited aspect of the individual's health.

The intended readers of the health summary will vary according to the primary purpose and focus of the summary, and may include:
- any future healthcare providers;
- clinicians who have no personal knowledge of the individual but are required to provide healthcare, such as emergency treatment or when the individual is travelling;
- clinicians managing only specific aspects of the individual's health, such as diabetes or pregnancy; and
- the individual themselves.

The main Sections/Content component has been deliberately left unconstrained. This will allow it to be populated with any SECTION or ENTRY archetypes appropriate for the clinical purpose within a template. 

Even though clinical content is unconstrained, this archetype supports simple querying for all Health summaries that might be contained within a health record.">
