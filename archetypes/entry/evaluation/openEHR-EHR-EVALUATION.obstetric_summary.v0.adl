Use this summary as the basis of statutory reporting regarding births.

Use to record the TPAL overview of an obstetric history, if required - the numbers of Term Births (T), Preterm Births (P), Abortions (A) and Living Children (L). Some variations add Gravidity (G) and number of Multiple Births (M).

Some data may be calculated or derived from individual pregnancy records if these are available.">
