= DIPS Archetype Repository 

== Why?
This is the collection of openEHR archetypes and templates that we work with in DIPS. 
Look at the collection as a working directory for archetypes that will later be published by national and / or international library. Eg. http://arketyper.no[arketyper.no].

== Structure

archetypes :: the folder with all archetypes
opt :: folder with usable compiled Operational Templates
templates :: folder with template created and edited in the Template Designer. You can happily use subdirectories for various projects.
doc :: documentation of different projects
