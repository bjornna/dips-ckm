= DIPS Archetype Repository

== Nymaster
We have introduced nymaster as the new master branch. This branc will only allow pull requests. This is done to have more control of files in the repository. 

 git fetch 
 git checkout master 

== Why?
This is the collection of openEHR archetypes and templates that we work with in DIPS.
Look at the collection as a working directory for archetypes that will later be published by national and / or international library. Eg. http://arketyper.no[arketyper.no].

== Structure

archetypes :: the folder with all archetypes
opt :: folder with usable compiled Operational Templates
templates :: folder with template created and edited in the Template Designer. You can happily use subdirectories for various projects.


doc :: documentation of different projects
