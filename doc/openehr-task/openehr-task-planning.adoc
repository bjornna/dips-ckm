== OpenEHR Medical Order Management 
The logical modules of openEHR Order Management are displayed in the image below and described in the following: 

image::arena_med_ord_modules.png[]

Service Catalogue:: A collection of all medical servics (to be ordered). The module provides a service interface (i.e. REST) and has an administrative userinterface to configure the content. 

Order Client:: Software (application) that uses the services provided by `Service Catalogue`to build concrete orders (Instructions) on medical servies. 

Order Management:: The component responsible of managing orders. 

Order Workflow:: The workflow engine which dispatches tasks to users/user groups and notifies when notification rules are asserted. 

Order Integration Broker:: The integration engine that works as a "middleware" with external systems. Sends and receives notification/messages. 

External System:: A system or organisation that manages or in other other ways are outside of the current instanse of the Order Management System. 

=== Functions that should be handled by the components 

==== Service Catalogue 

. Give me all services that I can order in this healthcare service provider (organisation) 
. Give me all lab.services which contains the word _ala_ 
. What are the timing requirements for patiens on a https://github.com/bjornna/dips-ckm/blob/nymaster/doc/kreftpakkeforl%C3%B8p/kreftforlop_dokumentasjon_en.adoc#21-eksempel-breast-cancer[breast cancer trajectory]
. Which container should be used when ordering Hemoglobin analysis? 
. What are the requirements to be able to order CT Caput for a 3o year old woman? 
. Give me the openEHR Composition (prototype) to for order set X 
. Why should patients with acute coronary syndrom measure blood pressure 2 times an hour? 

==== Order Management 
. Make sure that someone gives tablet X til patient Y 4 times daily in one week starting tomorrow at 10:00. 
. Stop all ongoing activities for patient A (he died) 
. Make sure that a full blood sample is taken of patient A and that the sample is sent to lab XY. The final report should be sent to me and Dr. Y. 
. Notify team A on channel X (SMS) when a report is present on order Y 

==== Order Integration Broker 
. Send this order to system X 
. What is the state of order A in system X
. Notify on channel X (SMS) that there is an report with pathological results on order Y 


== Activities related to clinical acitvities 

. Definisjon of order sets
.. define the service provider profile / catalogue 
. The order 
.. Will always contain information about *what* should be done 
.. May contain information about how to perform the activities 
.. May contain information about why the activity should be performed 
.. May include a specific procedure to be followed. One example might be lab.order where there is information about how to take the sample and handle the specimen and container. 
. Execution 
.. Those responsible or involved in doing the activity must document what is performed and when. This documentation makes sure that the requestor gets status on the progress of the activity. 
. Report 
.. After the execution of an acitivity the outcome will be evaluated and documented in a report. The report contains information about the `state`of the activity to let the requestor see that the activity is performed. 
. Evaluation, report and further assessments 
.. The requestor evaluates the report and makes assessment on the needs for further actvities to reach the target/goal. 
. Integration 
.. The activity might be performed in another system than the requestor is using.
.. There must be some kind of integration to make the above communication possible 
. Connection to evidence based knowledge 
.. Clinical activities is always (!) performed to reach a target. The activities are expensive for the society. That's why it is needed to only do activities which has docuemnted effect. Evidence based knowledge, i.e. http://www.magicapp.org[Magic], gives the requestor access to such information. Such "hardcore" evidence based knowledge is an addition to the "silent knowledge" and experienced based knowledge of the clinicia.
