= Intensive Care Unit 

== Background 
During a stay at an intensive care unit there will be several tasks to be performed. This example shows some task related to registration to national registry in Norway: https://www.kvalitetsregistre.no/registers/norsk-intensivregister[Norsk Intensivregister]

== Inclusion 
If the answer is yes to one of the following questions, then the patient/stay should be included in the national registry, 
and there should be reported: 

* <<SAPS_SCORE>> within the first 24 hours 
* <<NEMS_SCORE>> once pr. 24 hours. The nurse "day and night" starts at 07:00 and ends at 07:00 the next day.

|In own or other hospital

|3|Clinical|Did the patient die during the first 24 hours at ICU?

|Does not include those coming to ICU with the intention to die. 

|4|Clinical|Did the patient receive mechanical respiration support some time during the stay? 

(CPAP/mask ventilation/pressure ventilation)
|Respiration support must be evaluated during the complte stay at ICU - not only first 24 hours.

[[NEMS_SCORE]]
== NEMS 

Concept:: Nine Equivalents of Nursing Manpower Use Score (NEMS) is used for measuring nursing workload at the ICU level.

Purpose:: To record a score to measure the nursing workload at the ICU level.

Use:: 	Use to record a score to measure the nursing workload at the ICU level.
+
The NEMS score is usually perfomed by nurses and is recorded once pr. 24 hours. The score is performed by answering seven questions. The total sum of all the NEMS ordinals are recorded in the total score. A high score indicates a high level nursing workload.

[[SAPS_SCORE]]
== SAPS Score 

Concept:: Simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) is used for measuring severity of illness and to predict ICU mortality.

Purpose:: Simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) is used for measuring severity of illness and to predict ICU mortality.
The score provides an estimate of the risk of death without having to specify a primary diagnosis.


Use:: The SAPS II includes 17 variables: 12 physiology variables, age, type of admission (scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical), and three underlying disease variables (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy). 
+
The score uses the worst value (the one that gives the most points) in the last 24 hours.
+
The score is done once for each patient based on observations for the first 24 hours on an intensive care unit. The most deviant results from the period is used. The resulting score is used to calculate the risk of dying during the hospital stay.
