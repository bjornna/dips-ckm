[Preface]
== Foreword

=== Purpose
This document describes the clinical models (archetypes, templates and coding scheme) for compulsory psychiatric care. Here describes brief background information on the various processes as a basis for understanding the clinical models. The description of the clinical model aims to explain relationships that arrives by reading the archetypes isolated. Further, the purpose to explain why the modeling is done as described.

== Mental Healthcare (PH)

Mental health care is the specialist health examination and treatment of people with mental disorders. Implementation of mental health services is subject to the regional health authorities' responsibility.
https://helsedirektoratet.no/folkehelse/psykisk-helse-og-rus/psykisk-helsevern[Helsedirektoratet]

Within psychiatry through MHA opened for the use of coercion in mental health care. This presupposes that the strict conditions are met. Coercion in psychiatric institutions for the establishment of compulsory mental health care (commitment) and for the use of force during stay, including treatment without their consent, screening and the use of coercive measures.

To support the process of establishing coercion must electronic patient records (EPR) offer functionality to support the formal documents, provide information about relevant process support, visualiere patient pathways and support reporting to cooperating entities supervisory and public authorities. The purpose of these solutions is to ensure that patient rights are fulfilled and that the individual get the most effective treatment for his medical condition.

Mental health care is the treatment of a health condition in a subject. In other words offered mental health care within a patient care with a view to optimizing the mental state of the patient. Follow-up of a patient care requires specialist health a prior referral. It may in emergency situations immediately restored or it can come from cooperating health service.


Postulates :: Mental helsvern is a healthcare activity performed as part of a caring period (also called reference period)

=== Mandatory Mental Health Care
MHA authorizes that patients may be subjected to compulsory psychiatric care when special conditions are met.

Compulsory mental health care can be implemented in the form of:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
| Type of protection | Description

| Compulsory care with inpatient stays
a | patient must reside in the institution, and may be detained against their will. By escapes the patient may be retrieved by police.

| Compulsory care without overnight
a | The patient lives at home or remained voluntarily in an institution, but must periodically report to the treatment in the hospital or community mental health center (DPSet).

The patient in this case can not be held back in their own home or in an institution against his will. If the patient fails to appear for treatment, they can be retrieved with the assistance of police.

| forced observation
a | This means that patients can be detained in hospital for up to 10 days so that the hospital can assess whether the conditions for compulsory mental health care is present.

If the institution believes it is strictly necessary, the deadline may be extended by another 10 days after the inspection commission chairman consent.

|====

It is a requirement that every individual can only have an established tvungeng psychiatric care. Solutions must therefore support visualization and forecasting of ongoing voluntary - and compulsory psychiatric care.

=== Mental helsevernloven- and Regulations
Mental helsevernloven- and regulations shall ensure that the establishment and implementation of mental health care takes place in a proper manner and in accordance with fundamental legal principles, through:

* Which impose conditions for special measures
* Rules on procedures and control
* Rules ensuring that initiatives are based on the patient's needs and respect for human dignity, so that they are not used to a greater extent and scope than necessary

Mental Health Act is the main law enforcement on health law.
Access to forced intervention is partly based on consideration for the patient and partly in consideration of the environment. Compulsive use is a very serious intervention in the lives of individuals and self-determination.

It is important that rules designed to ensure patients' legal rights are easy to find and understand. This circular is intended to be helpful both for health professionals, patients, families, organizations, lawyers and others who are concerned with legal issues in mental health care.

== Establishment of Mental Health Care
The handbook contains a _very_ short preparing process to establish mental helsvern. The purpose is to provide a superior preparation process.

. Patient need mental health services and create a reference footnote: [Can perched addressed in primary care or immediate referral for acute conditions].
. The reference is evaluated and taken a position on whether protection can be carried out voluntarily.
.. Yes -> the establishment of voluntary mental health care
.. No -> it adopted compulsory observation for further examination of the patient
. Forced observation lasts up to 10 days and we must consider whether the patient may be subjected to mental health care or whether it must be established protection under duress (TPH)
.. No -> The adoption of compulsory mental health care


The figure below shows the process for the creation of mental health:

[[OPPF_TPH]]
== Monitoring of compulsory mental health care
For a patient care that is subject to compulsory psychiatric care will be carried out a protocol in the form of a series of activities and decision points to evaluate if there is still a need for coercion.

Control Commission :: must ensure that the correct procedure is followed, and it should consider the need for compulsory care after 3 months.

The professional responsible for :: decision should reconsider the need for compulsory care every 3 months. Compulsory mental health care may be extended by one year at a time, but those in charge of decisions should always consider whether compulsory mental health care may cease

In other words, two parallel processes related to assessment of the need for legal protection. Each process has various responsible:

* Control Commission
** Assess the need for compulsory care after 3 months
* Academic administrators
** Academic responsible for decisions should reconsider the need for compulsory care every three months
** Mandatory protection may be extended by one year at a time


The picture below illustrates the activities and decision points in this process.

The cycle within one year is therefore:

[cols="^1,^1,2,3",options="header"]
|====
2+| Period (Months) | responsible | Event
| 0 | 3 | Control Commission | Assess the need for legal protection
| 0 | 3 | Academic administrators | Reconsider the need for compulsory protection
| 3 | 6 | Academic administrators | Reconsider the need for compulsory protection
| 6 | 9 | Academic administrators | Reconsider the need for compulsory protection
| 9 | 12 | Academic administrators | Extending compulsory care (if needed)

=== Clinical modeling openEHR
I OPPF_TPH described activities and decision point for monitoring compulsory psychiatric care. These activities are a clinical process. This process is ongoing within one calendar year and has 5 subprocesses in 2 different roles.

The described process is modeled as *openEHR-EHR INSTRUCTION.follow_up.v1* 5 activities. Monitoring of each process is done as event registration within each activity using *openEHR-EHR ACTION.follow_up.v1*.

==== Start of process: openEHR-EHR INSTRUCTION.follow_up.v1
Implementation of oppfølfinges the activities done with the following entry in the patient's chart:

* OpenEHR-EHR INSTRUCTION.follow_up.v1
** Activity 1: Control Commission's assessment after 3 MONTHS
** Activity 2: Professional controller reassessment within 3 MONTHS
** Activity 3: Professional controller reassessment within 6 MONTHS
** Activity 4: Academic responsible reassessment within 9 MONTHS
** Activity 5: Professional controller extension within 12 MONTHS

After a user (role as program coordinator) approves such registration in the journal started the 5 parallel processes can be visualized and monitored in EPR.

Each ACTIVITY in _follow_up_ defined in a separate archetype called *openEHR-EHR ITEM_TREE.follow_up.v1*. The table below lists the items with a description of this structure.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|====
| Item | Description
| Service | Coded value for Ser residue to be performed. See <<DIPS-TPH-PROCESS>>
| Details | Details of the service
| Agreement date / time | It defined time if it is set up time for the follow-up
| Expiry date | CLUSTER - choose one of the items below
| Expires date | The date of the order expires. Audits should be initiated and completed before that date
| Expires within | Specifies an interval in which the service is performed. Interpreted as initiated by the lower interval and must be completed within the upper interval.

==== Event Registration: openEHR-EHR ACTION.follow_up.v1
To follow up activities related to the reassessment of the need for TPH made the event entries in the journal. These recordings using archetype * openEHR-EHR ACTION.follow_up.v1 *.
