In practice, Clinical Synopsis is a meta observation that will complement the existing structured clinical record, allowing for expression of subtle, subjective or interpretive information about the patient that might not otherwise be obvious through structured data alone, providing balance and context to the EHR record.  
For example, a Clinical Synopsis can communicate a succinct summary of the patient's hospital admission as one component of a comprehensive and structured Discharge Summary document.">
