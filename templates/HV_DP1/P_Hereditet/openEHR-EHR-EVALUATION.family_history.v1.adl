Additional detail about a genetic relative's specific problem or diagnosis can be captured using the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis archetype and specifying the 'Subject of Care' as the relative.

Use this archetype as the basis for a Family Pedigree chart of health problems/diagnoses.

It may be necessary to identify each Genetic Relative specifically and not just by the relationship to the patient. For example, while there will be only one maternal grandmother, there may be many female maternal cousins. This will ensure that a pedigree chart is accurate and allow for additional problems/diagnoses to be added, or existing records to be updated, for each identified genetic relative. If the record is private and will not be shared, for reasons of clarity it may be preferable to record the relative's name. If the record is to be shared, the genetic relative should be identified by a unique label or alias.(en)">
